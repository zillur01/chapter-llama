            " Now, recently YouTube has gone and done some house cleaning and they've deleted a shed load of subscribers from channels all over YouTube.",
            "So, don't worry, it's not just you.",
            "What they've done is they've deleted all the channels that they have cancelled, so are no longer in use.",
            "So, if you woke up one day and you have had less subscribers than you did the day before, this is the reason why.",
            " Now, you may not believe it but this actually is a good thing because now you have subscribers who are actually going to watch your videos and comment rather than those who have been suspended by YouTube and are no longer on your channel.",
            "So, this may be a short term loss but in the long run it's actually a good thing.",
            "So, there you go, that's the reason why you have experienced a big slump in your subscribers recently on your YouTube channel.",
            " Now, if this is still freaking you out, please leave a comment in the comments area below and let me know how you feel.",

When you're low in zinc, you're automatically going to be a little bit higher in copper because they work together. When you have this ratio right here, it's not good because then you start getting copper toxicity or copper overload and you get anxiety.",

So if this situation is going on, you need to do some additional things like olive leaf extract, colloidal silver, oregano oil, to handle the deeper source of the infection so your body doesn't have to utilize all this zinc. You can get zinc from shellfish, pumpkin seeds, Brazil nuts. So the point of this video is if you have some",

            " On the other hand, if you run your Flutter app in release mode, which you can do by calling this command flutter run and here you call then release.",
            "And with this, the debug banner is not visible anymore in release mode.",

            "And now after you hot reload you see that the debug banner is removed within the debug mode.",
            "One more small tip is how you can see if you are running your app in a debug mode or in a release mode.",
            " So every time if you have here this Hot Reload and Hot Restart inside, then you are running for sure in the debug mode because the Hot Reload feature and Hot Restart feature is only available in the debug mode.",

            "Colic is when a baby is super fussy due to extra air being trapped in their tummies.",
            "This bottle is unique because it has a two-piece internal venting system.",

            "These bottles help reduce colic, spit up, burping, and gas.",
            "Since the vent system removes air from the milk or formula, it also helps maintain essential vitamins.",

            "So it's probably a good idea to place these non-slip bathtub stickers in yours as well to ensure safety.",
            " It's easy and light to set up and maintain.",
            "Just stick the individual stickers on the inner surface of your bathtub or shower floor.",
            "Each sticker is made where it easily sticks to the surface using special glue.",
            "The sticker has some small bumps which you can play a non-slip effect, which helps increase friction but also gets water flowing freely.",
            " What's great about these stickers is that they're designed to strongly grip onto smooth surfaces.",
            "It's made up of soft PVA material, which is long-lasting.",
            "And you can totally take it off easily too.",
            "Because of the special glue, these stickers can be removed without leaving any residue behind.",
            "They're also non-toxic, fade-free, safe, and convenient to use.",
            " The package has 14 pieces of stickers and includes a high quality silicone scraper.",
            "And if you're not sure how many you need, one pack should occupy at least 2 thirds of the tub surface.",
            "Your bathtub should be a haven of security and fun for your child, not a slippery accident waiting to happen.",
            "These can be mentioned in the explanation.",
            "I hope you try these out.",

            "You are most likely aware the remodeling industry is flooded with unlicensed contractors.",

            " you've also got these two jacks here which can take an xlr that is like a microphone cable or a quarter inch like a instrument cable and that means that you're going to have four audio tracks there's a control that'll let you turn up or down the sensitivity of the microphones but",
            " and these also have dedicated knobs look at your screen while it's on and it'll show your meter readings and you'll know right away if you're redlining if your band is very loud you can turn this knob and if it's very quiet your source and you need to really boost it you can do that as well it's got a touchscreen for all the different settings you can touch files and you want to play a file you just push the file and then you just plug your headphones in",
            " and you can make sure the video looks good, the audio is fine.",

            " Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make Pasta Pomodoro.",
            "This classic Italian pasta is simple but totally delicious.",
            "It starts with 28 ounces of whole peeled tomatoes.",
            "You want to look for San Marzano style on the label because those have the most flavor.",
            "We're going to pour it all into a blender, all of those in there,",
            " Pop the lid on and then we're going to puree these until they're smooth.",
            " Once that's pureed set it aside.",
            "We're going to head on over to the stove and get a large skillet heating over medium-high heat.",
            "First get 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil heating up, and then we'll add in 1 finely diced onion.",
            "Saute this for about 5 minutes until the onions start to turn soft and translucent.",
            "Then we'll add in 5 cloves of minced garlic,",
            " and 1 1⁄4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.",
            "Give this a quick saute.",
            "You only need to cook the garlic for about 60 seconds.",
            "Then we're going to pour in our tomato puree.",
            "Get that all in there.",
            "Scrape out some that's sticking to the sides.",
            "Then we're going to season it with about 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt.",
            " Bring this to a simmer and then turn the heat to low and let it simmer for another 10 minutes.",
            "This will help the sauce develop a little bit more flavor.",
            "Meanwhile we're going to cook our pasta.",
            "Cook 1 pound of spaghetti noodles in salted boiling water until al dente.",
            "Once your pasta has reached al dente go ahead and drain it, and pour that in with the sauce, and then we'll toss to coat.",
            " I'm actually going to switch to my tongs here.",
            "It'll be a little easier to toss that way.",
            "Then we're going to add in 2 tablespoons of salted butter.",
            "The heat from the pasta will melt this as we toss it all in, and then you'll also need 1 quarter cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese.",
            "Keep tossing.",
            " Using freshly grated parmesan cheese makes all the difference.",
            "Once the butter is melted and the cheese is mixed in, you're ready to eat.",
            "Serve this up hot topped with some freshly chopped basil.",
            " Thanks for watching!",

            "Although these withdrawals, in my opinion, are not too significant, but again, they are worth paying attention to because if I was to take modafinil for two weeks straight and just suddenly get off modafinil, I would feel like my normal self.",

            "Dump the 5-6 ounces of regular milk into the cup.",

            "I don't really recommend making this by hand unless you want a really good or workout.",
            "We'll start by combining one stick, or 1/2 cup, of unsalted butter and 8 ounces of cream cheese in the bowl of your stand mixer.",
            "You'll want these to be softened to room temperature",
            "Next add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of salt",
            "Finally, gradually add your powdered sugar. This recipe calls for 4 cups of powdered sugar.",
            "Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl so that you get all of your powdered sugar well incorporated.",
            "At this point your frosting is really done and ready to go!",
            "Look at how smooth and creamy that is! I'm going to put this in a piping bag and pipe it on some cupcakes,",
            "But this makes enough to spread on a two layer 8 inch or 9 inch cake as well.",
            "Today I'll be piping this cream cheese frosting on my carrot cake cupcakes.  I'm using an Ateco 848 large tip.",

            " Hey everyone, welcome to Pape Machinery Toolkit. My name is Robert Thompson. I'm a Territory Manager with Pape Machinery. I've been in the John Deere industry for 25 years now and hopefully today we're going to learn something new about John Deere compact tractors.",
            " Hey, welcome back everybody. Today we got a little video we're going to show you the differences between the 1 Series 1025R tractor and the 2025R tractor. Although these tractors are very similar, they share the same loader, they share the same backhoe, lift capacity, digging depth, all that stuff stays the same. What we're going to see is the biggest difference is going to be tractor size. So",
            " 2025R to be a little bit larger tractor, a little bit more weight to it, a longer wheelbase, bigger tires and more ground clearance. So if ground clearance is an issue, if you're going to be out in the forest or off-roading and you got stumps and rocks, that's going to come into play for you.",
            " The One Series is a little bit lighter, a little bit narrower or shorter wheelbase tractor, so it's got a little bit tighter turning radius. If maybe you're going to be in a barn or working around inside of a barn and stalls and stuff, this might be a better fit for you. A little bit lower profile, a little bit smaller tires, but again, both pieces share the same bucket, the same backhoe, the same seat, the same horsepower.",
            " similar in that aspect just kind of what's your preference do you need a little bit more low profile with a tighter turning radius or do you need a little more ground clearance with a heavier duties taller tire either way deer's got you covered if you want to go larger or smaller deer's got the right solution for you"

            " Hi everybody, if you've ever struggled trying to find the centre of something, it could be a piece of trunking, centre of a piece of wood or something like that, I might have the perfect solution for you.",
            "So here we go, let's get into it.",
            "So all you need guys is a tape measure, pencil and we want to find the centre.",
            "So what we've got here is a piece of wood, it could be anything really, it doesn't really matter.",
            "This trick I've used on a number of occasions.",
            " and obviously if you've got some trunking and you know the width it's easy to find the center but you might not be as clever at maths or whatever struggle working the centers out as we can see there it's 100mm 50mm is easy to find the center that's not always the case",
            " So what we're going to do is we're going to use this tape measure, and we're going to use it at an angle.",
            "And I'll show you now.",
            "I'll give you a demonstration to find the center of this block of wood.",
            "So obviously, it measures 70.",
            "Clearly, the middle would be 35.",
            "But if that's going to be difficult for people to work out, it could be some obscure measurement that you're trying to work out, and it's very difficult.",
            "So if we offer this at an angle, it doesn't really make any difference what the angle is.",
            " and adjust the tape so that it's at a measurement that we can easily find.",
            "So it's like this, there's 100mm.",
            "So I'm just going to move the tape down a little bit, there we go, so it's 100mm.",
            "Clearly the centre of that is 50mm, okay, and works on any piece of timber or trunking or tray or whatever it is that you're trying to find the centre of.",
            "It also works the other way.",
            " So if you're trying to find the center on the opposite side, again, you can find the center very, very easily.",
            "Or if you prefer using inches, I'm showing you, you can use four inches.",
            "And again, spin it around if you wish to get the center of the timber or trunking or tray or whatever it happens to be.",
            "So I hope you've enjoyed this video, and I look forward to seeing you on the next one."

            " Many people plant grass seed in spring, and while this is an acceptable time to plant grass in Minnesota, it is not necessarily the best time.",

            " So when you fertilize the grass seed, you are also fertilizing weeds.",

            "So AJ, what is this stuff?",
            "4032 is a printable polyurethane film for all your high quality full color transfers.",
            "It comes with a sticky liner so you can get some of the fine cutting detail after you do your printing as well.",
            "It's only 80 microns so you don't have to worry about feeling bulky or anything on the garment.",
            " I bet that feels nice on a t-shirt.",
            "It does feel really good.",
            "That's awesome.",
            "So can I use this stuff on my desktop printer?",
            "Do I have to have something specific or how can I print on this stuff?",
            "So it's not going to work on your standard inkjet or laser desktop printers.",
            "This material is made for your wide format printers such as like Roland, Mamaki, HP latex printers, different things like that.",
            " Awesome.",
            "So where can I use this stuff?",
            "Is it just strictly only on like, can I use it on hard surfaces or what can I do with it?",
            "It's primarily and really just for the garments.",
            "So all your cotton, polyester blends, those things, it's going to work perfectly for that.",
            "Full color logos, really what you're going to get away with is not layering colors like different cuttable heat transfer films.",
            "This is printable, so it's only going to be one layer thick and that's really all it's going to be on the garment.",
            " Oh, okay.",
            "Sounds good.",
            "Well, what is the lifespan for this printable vinyl compared to just regular normal HTV?",
            "So, it's going to be very similar.",
            "So, any of the products that we offer have been wash tested for all of them range, but this material here goes for 50 plus washes.",
            "You're not going to see any fading of colors, any wrinkling.",
            "It's a polyurethane again, so it expands and contracts as when the garment shrinks or anything like that.",
            " Alright, well that sounds awesome.",

            "And don't forget, you guys, you can find this recipe on my blog, divasandcook.com, with a ton of other recipes.",
            "So go on over there and check it out.",

            "So yeah, the parsley works great.",

            "It just works.",
            "I don't know why, but sausage balls and grape jelly sauce just works.",

            "Cueing is the process of setting markers, called cues, at key points in your track that can be accessed at the push of a button.",
            "These cues could be set at the first drum beat of a track, a vocal, the start of a build-up or breakdown, or anywhere in a track you'd like to jump to instantly at the press of a button.",
            " To set a basic cue point, simply scrub through the track using the jog wheel.",
            "While the cue button is blinking, if you press the cue button, a new cue will be set.",
            "When the main cue button is lit, if you press the cue button, it will jump to a preset cue point.",
            " Pressing and holding the Cue button and then pressing Play allows the track to be started from that preset Cue and to continue playing without jumping back to that Cue point when the Cue button is released.",
            "Another Cueing technique is with a Hot Cue.",
            "In WeDJ, you can set up to 8 separate Hot Cues for each track, labeled A through H, and assign them to a button in WeDJ or, for even more precise control, a Performance Pad on the DDJ-200.",
            " Use the jog wheel to find the part of the track you want to set a hot cue and press the performance pad for Hot Cue A. Now, whenever the pad is pressed, the track will instantly play back from that position.",
            "Let's scrub through the track and set two more hot cues at different parts of the track.",
            "Hot cues usually work best when you set them at the first downbeat of a phrase, like breakdowns, build-ups, or drops.",
            " The hot cues in this example are all set to a downbeat, the first beat of a bar.",
            "This means you can jump instantly and seamlessly between all three hot cues, meaning the mix can be more varied and creative.",
            "It also helps to shorten or lengthen tracks if needed whilst mixing.",
            "To delete a hot cue is simple.",
            "Just hold down shift while in hot cue pad mode and press the pad corresponding to the hot cue you want to delete.",
            "You can also use the performance pads in the hot cue mode to access hot loops.",
            " These are manually set loops that you can assign to one of the performance pads.",
            "To do this, access loop mode on the performance pads and use the manual controls to set an in and out point for a custom loop.",
            "Tap pad A for your in point and B for your out point.",
            "Then access hot cue pad mode.",
            "Press any of the performance pads to assign the loop to that pad.",
            "Now when you press that pad in hot cue mode, that loop will be instantly activated and you will jump back to the start of that loop.",
            " Once again, you can clear the loop by pressing the pad while holding the Shift button.",
            "Using Hot Cues is the basis for many more creative mixing and performance techniques, so it is good to get used to using and mastering them."

            "Along with outdoor kitchens, outdoor fireplaces have grown in popularity since the crash of 2008.",
            "The largest reason for this is the fact that many people are underwater on their mortgage and cannot sell their homes.",
            "They're spending money to update them and to make them more marketable.",
            " Combine that with the weather in Georgia, then you have the perfect storm for creating an outdoor living space.",
            "With today's beautiful and convenient gas fireplaces and tables, this is a home run for many families.",
            "After working all day, who wants to come home and build a fire?",

            "Accompany this outdoor fireplace with an outdoor kitchen, and you will never want to go out again.",
            "If you enjoy burning wood, we recommend a fireplace with a full chimney.",
            " Fire pits are cool in theory, but who wants to be chased around by smoke and smell like you've been camping at the end of the night?",
            "We have prefabricated options that are a fraction of the price of traditional masonry fireplaces.",
            "Best yet is, they are 304 stainless steel and will not rust.",
            "They get the smoke up and out of your face and also make a great place for your outdoor television.",
            " To build a quality outdoor fireplace, it all starts with the foundation and framework.",
            "If exposed to the elements, we recommend that it is completely built out of non-combustible materials.",
            "A common shortcut is to frame the fireplace enclosure with pressure-treated wood.",
            " This is problematic due to the fact that wood absorbs moisture, which will cause the wood to swell.",
            "This will in turn damage your fascia and ruin your investment.",
            "A popular way to finish your fireplace is to match or accent the aesthetics of your home, whether it is stucco, brick, stack rock, or tile.",
            "If building an elaborate outdoor fireplace doesn't excite you, then purchasing a simple gas fire table should do the trick.",
            " Gas tables come in many shapes and sizes.",
            "You can choose a contemporary linear coffee table or a traditional looking one with logs.",
            "The great thing about this option is that you can take it wherever you go.",

            "Today in the garage we're going to be showing you how to install our new SS3 vertical bracket on a 2013 to 2018 Ram 1500.",
            "Let's get started.",
            "For this install we'll need a 5 30 seconds allen key, a ratchet, a 10 millimeter socket, and we use an extension but you can get away without using one.",
            " To start off, we'll come over to the driver's side of the vehicle.",
            "As you can see, we have our wheels turned all the way to the right.",
            "This is so that we have easy access to the back of the bumper to remove the factory fog light.",
            "You can easily do this by reaching underneath of the bumper.",
            "We're just doing it this way to give you a better view.",
            "Our first step is going to be to disconnect the factory fog light harness and then grab ourselves a 10 millimeter socket because we'll be removing these three bolts holding the factory fog light onto the back of the bumper.",
            "Make sure you save these bolts because we'll be reusing them to install the new bracket.",
            " Now that the factory fog light removed our next step is to assemble our SS3 to our bracket.",
            "To do this you'll need your supplied hardware and a 5 30 seconds allen key.",
            "Our first step is to take our supplied nuts and drop them into the back of the SS3 with the nylon lock washer facing the inside.",
            "Now we can take our bracket with the DD logo on the top and then feed our SS3 in through the bottom lining up the holes on the side of the bracket with the holes on the side of the SS3.",
            " Now we can take our supplied bolt and washer and screw them in through the side of the bracket on either side of the SS3, leaving them only hand tight to save room for adjustment later.",
            "Now we have our SS3 assembled to our bracket, we can go ahead and install it on the vehicle.",
            "Coming from the back of the bumper, we'll be installing our new assembly by lining up the holes on the bracket with the factory mounting points and then securing them using our factory screws.",
            " Next, we can take our supplied Deutsch connector and plug it into the back of the SS3, and then take the other side and plug it into the factory fog light harness.",
            "Go ahead and test it, and if it doesn't work, don't worry, just flip this 180 degrees and it should come on just fine.",
            " Moving to the front of the vehicle we're going to go ahead and make our final aiming adjustments then once we're happy with where those are aimed we can go ahead and tighten down those 2 5 30 seconds allen bolts in the back of the bracket.",
            "As you can see with our SS3 fog light kit installed not only will it give you a huge increase in light output over your factory fog lights but also give you a more clean and modern look.",
            "If you're looking to pick up an SS3 fog light kit for your vehicle or any of our other products visit our website at Diodedynamics.com or use our dealer locator tool to find a dealer near you thanks for watching."

            "In some cases, your issue isn't the bulbs at all.",

            "Now, if the headlight lenses on your vehicle are too far gone, say you've restored them before and they've clouded up all over again, or they've gotten moisture inside, what you may need to do is replace the headlight assemblies themselves.",
            " Many vehicles have assemblies available that can be changed by simply removing a few bolts and detaching a wiring harness.",
            "The replacement will be well worth the improvement in visibility, not to mention how much better the front end of your vehicle will look.",

            "We all know these days that roller blinds are the most popular blinds about, and of the roller blinds, most people like to get dual rollers, which just simply means a blockout roller blind that you can pull down at night",
            " and a screen roller blind that you can pull down during the day for privacy.",
            "Now, there's many different ways you can mount the blinds on your windows.",
            "One way is to put both the roller blinds inside the window frame, which is fine if you've got the room.",
            "However, you can get gaps at the side and a little bit of lighting.",
            "The other way is to put the two roller blinds on the face or on the frame of the window.",
            "Once again, which is fine, but because they're both on the face,",
            " The second blind sticks out quite a distance and comes into the room, and some people don't like that.",
            "So what's the third way, with inner and outers?",
            "Well, this is the way we prefer to install the dual rollers.",
            "As you can see on this photo here, we have a screen blind on the inside of the window, and that's called the inner blind.",
            "And then we have a block-out roller blind on the face of the window, and that's called the outer blind.",
            " So that's corded inner and outer.",
            "There's a couple of advantages.",
            "One, the blockout's on the face and it stops all the light from coming through.",
            "There's no gaps.",
            "Two, the cord for the blockout and the cord, or I should say chain, are on separate locations, so there's no confusion in terms of mixing them up.",
            "And also, generally because both the inner and the outer blinds both have the fabric rolling over the back, you pull the chain in the same direction on both blinds to pull the blinds up and down.",
            " So there's just a few advantages of having your blinds as an inner and outer.",
            "It doesn't always work that way, but generally most windows can be set up like that, and if they can, that's what we would recommend you do.",
