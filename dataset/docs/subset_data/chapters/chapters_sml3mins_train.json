And while Squarespace doesn't give you an option in the admin controls to hide those tags, you can use a very small bit of custom code to hide tags on your Squarespace blog. With that being said, the code snippet is different depending on whether you're using a Squarespace 7.0 or a Squarespace 7.1 site. I'll cover both in this video.\n\nNow let's walk through the steps to hide tags at the bottom of your Squarespace blog posts.\n\nStep 1. Open your web browser and navigate to Account.Squarespace.com, and then click the site you want to hide blog tags on. You'll land on the home page for that site.\n\nStep 2. Click \"Design\" in the menu on the left side of the screen. The Design screen is displayed.\n\nStep 3. Click \"Custom CSS.\" The Custom CSS screen is shown.\n\nStep 4. If you're using a Squarespace 7.0 site, you'll want to enter the code that's currently on the screen in the text entry area. Alternatively, if you're using a Squarespace 7.1 site, you'll need to enter the code that's currently on the screen in the text entry area. I'll include both code snippets in the description for this video.\n\nStep 5. After entering the code click \"Save\" at the top of the screen. The change will be applied automatically, and you'll no longer see tags at the bottom of your Squarespace blog posts.",

Watch now!\n\n0:06 Finishing Your Basement Is A Major Project But...\n0:23 Need An Extra Bedroom\n0:53 Determine Your Budget And Consider Time\n1:15 Learn A Simple Way To Get It Done\n\nRegardless if it's currently cold concrete and filled with containers of off-season decorations, the lowest floor in your home usually has lots of potential. Treat it as you would any of the rooms aboveground, and it may just turn out to be the most popular spot in the house\u2014for much less money than adding on. Here's our bottom-line advice for transforming this underutilized space into a place you'll be willing to spend time in.\n\nFirst, consider your finances. The cost of your project is important to determine. Hiring an authorized design consultant is a good idea, and they could help you save a few bucks.\n\nNext, consider the basement environment. Basements naturally end up having moisture, so make sure the materials you use are resistant to mold and mildew.\n\nAfter that you will want to consider the possible disturbance to your home. You need to take into account how long the installation will take and the kind of mess it will cause. For example, a typical drywall installation may take up to two months, require numerous contractors, and is messy.\n\nAnother piece of advice is about the contractor you will use to complete the project. If your goal is to get it done properly, hire an expert to handle the job. Make sure that the company has the appropriate credentials before you decide to allow them into your home.\n\nLastly, consider protecting your investment. A warranty helps protect your brand-new basement and ensure its longevity.

    "description": "If you are asked to certify a copy of a document \u2014 that is, to vouch for the fact that the copy is true and accurate \u2014 you need to know a few important facts about state Notary laws before doing so. For more information, visit the Notary Bulletin: http://bit.ly/CertifyCopyDoc\n\nNotaries aren't allowed to certify copies in every state. It\u2019s the signer\u2019s responsibility \u2014 not the Notary\u2019s \u2014 to check if copying a document violates a law or will be accepted by a receiving agency. Remember not to provide unauthorized legal advice to the signer. You can mention that you may perform a copy certification by document custodian but should not suggest or recommend that to the signer.\n\nProcess for Copy Certification\n\n00:32 - Step 1: The document\u2019s custodian requests a certified copy\nThe keeper of the original document appears before you and asks you to certify a copy of the original document.\n\n00:51 -  Step 2: The Notary compares the original and the copy\nThe custodian presents the original document and the copy so that you may confirm the copy is identical to the original.\n\n01:07 Step 3: The Notary certifies that the copy is accurate\nOnce you have confirmed the copy matches the original, you complete and attach to the copy a notarial certificate stating that the copy is true, accurate and complete.\n\nIf you are asked to certify a copy of an unusual document and aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s permissible, always check your state requirements first, or contact your state Notary regulating office.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nHandling Certified Copies Of Public Records: http://bit.ly/35o2r8h\nNotary Basics: Avoiding The Unauthorized Practice Of Law: http://bit.ly/3ouMWTh\n\nConnect with the NNA:\nBlog: https://www.nationalnotary.org/notary-bulletin\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nationalnotary\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nationalnotary\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nationalnotary\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/nationalnotary\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-notary-association/\n\n#Notary #NotaryTraining #HowToNotarize",

That\u2019s sad\u2026 because we\u2019re all designed to be Under the Influence.\n\nNone of us exists apart from the impact of other individuals; their control on our life experience is irrefutable. Some individuals in your life are forces who make you better, because of them; others have the potential to bring you to places that don\u2019t make you better, and can only leave you less.\n\nThe Lord has given you the ability to have a deep positive influence in the individuals around you, and that happens when your soul connects with another person at a powerful - dare I say, \u201csupernatural\u201d - level. That force is love, and it is supposed to define our connection with the people in our lives who become the recipients of our regard.\n\nTune in on today\u2019s topic: it will change the way you look at yourself in relationship to the people who populate your life!\n\nWould you like to learn more and connect with an online mentor to help you grow in all that God has desired for you?

Also visit www.basementresources.ocboston.com/781/\n\n0:06 5 Important Basement Finishing Tips\n0:23 Make Sure The Materials You Use Are Resistant To Mold\n0:53 Save You A Few Dollars\n1:14 Hire An Expert To Handle The Job\n\nEven if it's currently cold cement and loaded with bins of off-season decor, the lowest level of your home probably has lots of potential. Treat it just like you would any of the rooms aboveground, and it may just turn into the most favored spot in the house\u2014for a lot less cash than adding on. Here's our bottom-line advice for turning this underutilized space into a place you'll be eager to spend time in.\n\nFirst, think about your budget. The cost of your project is very important to determine. Hiring an authorized design consultant is a good idea, and they could help you save a few dollars.\nNext, consider the basement environment. Basements naturally end up having moisture, so make sure that the materials you use are resistant to mold and mildew.\n\nThen you will want to consider the possible disruption to your home. You need to take into account how long the installation will take and the kind of mess it may cause. For example, a typical drywall installation may take up to two months, require multiple contractors, and is messy.\n\nAnother piece of advice is about the contractor you might use to complete the project. If your objective is to get it done correctly, hire a skilled professional to handle the job. Make sure the company has the necessary qualifications before you allow them into your home.\n\nAnd lastly, consider protecting your investment. A warranty helps protect your basement and ensure its longevity.

Although some still choose to DIY, the fact that a painting contractor can guarantee a perfect, professional finish means most homeowners hire an expert painter for the project.\n\nMore people than ever are outsourcing their residential painting jobs, which has led to 5% industry growth in the past five years. However, just because searching for \"painting contractor jobs near me\" gets results, it doesn't mean every painter has unlimited access to painting leads. To find painting jobs, you not only need to put yourself out there \u2014 you need to have a winning pitch, slick website, and plenty of online reviews to encourage potential clients to select you over your competitors.\n\nWord of mouth, referrals, and a presence in online directories is all well and good, but you need to be proactive to get ahead. Traditional marketing and digital marketing efforts should be combined to get maximum results, but getting it right can be extremely time-consuming.\nWith CraftJack leads for painting contractors, you get to focus on what you do best: winning painting jobs and completing them to the best of your ability. Not only do we make sure the leads are specific to your painting specialty, we ensure they get you in touch with individuals looking for residential painting contractors nearby.\n\nIt doesn't end there. CraftJack provides a ton of resources for customers, from our blog with extensive tips and advice for contractors to the CraftJack Pro App and a dedicated account manager. With the app, you have access to our Lead Manager tool, which lets you choose the painting and staining categories your company specializes in. Painting contractor categories include interior painting and staining, exterior painting and staining, paint removal and cleaning, special finishes, pressure washing, sandblasting, and painting metal roofing.\n\nYou can even set up your own portfolio, demonstrating the excellent work you've done for customers, to make it even easier to win jobs. With Lead Manager and the Pro App, you can access leads, make job notes, and track job progress from literally anywhere. Painting contractors can also set their budget, pick a designated location and lead diameter, select a category, and even receive discounts.\n\nYou heard right. CraftJack offers a speed-to-call discount, which guarantees 20% off the price of every residential painting lead you contact within 30 minutes of getting the details. The beauty of this discount is that it's a win-win for you and your customers. Our research shows that the faster a contractor contacts a lead, the more likely they are to win the job. So you're more likely to win when you pay less! Customers win because they get their job completed as quickly as possible, by the best possible painting contractor for the job: you.\n\nOur primary aim is to help our contractors win as many jobs as possible so they can develop their reputation, make more money, and become an industry leader. But there's more. We go over and above other painting lead generation services by offering your customers the chance to leave CraftJack Reviews for free, without you lifting a finger. The more positive reviews you get, the easier it is to win painting jobs.\n\nThat's because of something called social proof, which explains why people are so drawn to positive reviews. And getting great reviews is easy. All you have to do is put your best foot forward, complete painting jobs to the best of your ability, and deliver excellent customer service.\nBeing friendly, well-presented and having high standards is all it takes to reap awesome reviews. And with CraftJack, all it takes to start getting more painting leads nearby is signing up, downloading the app, and making the most of our extensive resources.

All the major groups of marine invertebrates as well as all aquatic vertebrates live in this zone since this is the only area of the ocean where photosynthesis occurs. Temperatures can vary anywhere between 25*C near the equator down to about 5*C near the poles.\n*The 2nd layer known as the bath-E-al zone, starts where light stops and goes down to the average depth of the ocean floor about 4,000 meters down. Since this area is in complete darkness 24 hours every day no plants live in this zone as well as the zones below. How-ever all the major groups of marine vertebrates such as whales & fish as well as all the major invertebrate groups inhabit this zone. Since light gets absorbed in the layer above, this zone averages temperatures at about 5*C to 4*C all over earth.\n*The 3rd layer known as the abyssal zone, starts from the average depth of the ocean floor down to about 6,000 meters where most trenches and troughs begin. The only marine vertebrates that inhabit this zone are fish because the massive amount of pressure would pop the lungs of these vertebrates. Despite the pressures all major groups of invertebrates still inhabit the abyssal plains. Average temperatures of this zone vary between 3*C & 2*C.\n*The 4th layer known as the hadal zone, starts at 6,000 meters where the 14 known troughs and 33 known trenches begin. The Mariana trench bottoms out at about 11,000 meters. With pressures 1,000 times the PSI of the atmosphere you might think that this hostile environment couldn't possibly contain living organisms. How-ever very few fish species as well as all the major known invertebrate's groups make their home here. Temperatures this far down stay just above freezing and don't complete freeze due to extremely high temperatures from thermal vents as well as having the highest salinity levels of the entire ocean.\n\nHOW DEEP IS THE OCEAN [720p]\n\n\"science experiments\" \"cool science experiments\" \"science fair projects\" \"science experiments for children\" \"science fair project ideas\" \"science experiments gone wrong\" \"science tricks\" \"science experiments for school\" \"science fair projects for school\" \"science experiments to do at home\" \"science experiments you can do at home\" \"science experiments explosions\" \"science experiments cool\" \"science experiments at home\" \"science experiments easy\"",

Learn how to build short-term savings that will leave you prepared for whatever life throws your way.\n\n\n0:00 What is an emergency fund?\n0:17 How much money should be in your emergency fund?\n0:33 How to create an emergency fund \n\n \nLife can be unpredictable, which is why setting aside some money in an emergency fund is a good idea.\nEmergency funds are short-term savings to help pay for unexpected life situations like a job loss, car or home repairs, and sudden illness or injury.\nMorningstar\u2019s director of personal finance, Christine Benz, suggests having three to six months of living expenses set aside. If you can cut costs in a pinch, like splitting rent between roommates or moving in with your parents, you might not need as large of an emergency fund.\nEmergency funds need to be very accessible. You should consider placing your cash into a savings account.\nIf you have additional savings, try putting that money to work in a tax-friendly retirement account like an IRA and invest in a diversified stock fund.\nSetbacks happen to us all, but an emergency fund can help mitigate the impact and get back on your feet.\n\nGet answers to other financial questions. \n\nHow to Set and Invest Your Emergency Fund: https://www.morningstar.com/articles/827411\n6 Reasons to Tap Your Emergency Fund: https://www.morningstar.com/articles/920944\nThe New Math on Emergency Funds: https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1009474\nHow to Create a Budget: https://youtu.be/8PBb_2w-AA0\nHow Inflation Affects Your Paycheck: https://youtu.be/0qDPJxXpNf4 \n\nFollow us on social.  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MorningstarInc/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MorningstarInc \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/morningstar... \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/5161/",

Be responsible and do this outdoors away from any flamable substances.\n\nThis chemistry trick works because the alchohol (rubbing/isopropanol) solution we made had an equal mix of water and alchohol. The water protects the dollar bill while the alchohol vapor burns. This results in a cool burning dollar effect without actually damaging the dollar.  The dollar bill will just end up being a little damp.",

    "title": "How To: Fix Dim Headlights",
    "description": "Dim headlights can make being able to see while you\u2019re driving in the dark difficult. Having the best headlights possible is essential for nighttime driving. So, if you notice that you\u2019ve got a headlight bulb or bulbs that aren\u2019t quite as bright as they should be\u2014or as they used to be\u2014we have a few simple fixes to help restore your headlights. \n\nSupplies Needed for This Job:\n1.

From our roots as a single store in 1957 to our current size of 5,219 locations (and growing), we've come a long way. We pride ourselves on offering well researched, and reliable automotive information on our channel.\n\n#OReillyPowered #CarRepair\n#TeamOReilly #CarMaintenance\n\nThe first is just the possibility that you need a new bulb. As those filaments inside the bulb start to age, they can deposit a residue that keeps headlights from being as bright as they used to be. That\u2019s an easy enough fix\u2014just stop by one of our stores and grab a pair of headlight bulbs. I say \u201ca pair\u201d because it\u2019s a good idea to change them both at once. If one is fading or failing, chances are, the other one isn\u2019t far behind it. \n\nOn that note, it could also be that you just need a brighter bulb, and that might be most noticeable if you\u2019ve only changed one of the two. The other bulb may just be older, or it could be a different bulb that doesn\u2019t provide as much light as the other. So remember to replace them together, and consider choosing bulbs that put out more light than your previous bulbs. \n\nIn some cases, your issue isn\u2019t the bulbs at all. Over time, the headlight assemblies or lenses of your headlights can start to cloud up and keep the lights inside of them from shining as brightly as they were intended to. In many cases, what\u2019s needed is a headlight restoration kit, which can take the film off the outside of headlight lenses. This\u2019ll allow light to pass through the way it was designed to and improve nighttime driving visibility. \n\nNow, if the headlight lenses on your vehicle are too far gone\u2014say you\u2019ve restored them before and they\u2019ve clouded up all over again, or they\u2019ve gotten moisture inside\u2014what you may need to do is replace the headlight assemblies themselves. Many vehicles have whole assemblies available that can be changed by simply removing a few bolts and detaching a wiring harness. The replacement will be well worth the improvement in visibility, not to mention how much better the front end of your vehicle will look.",

Welcome back to another tutorial on Eclipse. In this video you will learn how to export Eclipse projects. \n\nTime - 00:10\nWhen you want to share your project with other developers, you can simply export the project. Eclipse will create a zip file of your project and this will include your source code and project settings. Another developer will be able to use your project by simply importing the project. If you'd like to learn how to import a project, check out my other video on importing projects.\n\nTime - 00:30\nTo export your project, right click the project and select export. Then go to general, choose archive file, click next. Choose browse and give it a file name. In this example we'll give demo-test.zip. Hit save and go ahead and click the option to Use Zip. Once that's finished, go ahead and select finish.\n\nTime - 01:08\nAt this point, Eclipse created a zip file for you on your file system. Let's go to our file system and verify that the file is there. Here you can see demotest.zip. This project was exported successfully.\n\nTime - 01:24\nAll righty. This wraps up our video on exporting projects in Eclipse. Please subscribe to our channel to view more videos on Eclipse. Also click the thumbs up to like our video.

This means that, and it's an important thing to remember, the swelling occurs above the vocal cords. That is the primary way to differentiate this condition from Croup because instead, it has subglottic swelling which means that it occurs below the vocal cords. Epiglottitis is a condition that is often life-threatening and should be considered a medical emergency. The patient will likely require immediate intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. Another thing that you should know is that Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection that is often caused by Haemophilus influenza bacteria. Therefore, antibiotics can be used to treat this infection.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Epiglottitis Signs and Symptoms:\n\u25aa Rapid onset\n\u25aa Trouble swallowing\n\u25aa Altered voice\n\u25aa Dyspnea\n\u25aa Stridor\n\u25aa Fever\n\u25aa Drooling\n\u25aa Tachypnea\n\u25aa Sore Throat\n\nIf you or a patient has been diagnosed with a condition or are experiencing symptoms, as always, please speak with your doctor for medical advice and treatment.\n\n\ud83d\udca5Epiglottitis [Full Guide] \u279c \u279c \u279c https://bit.ly/2NDbOYg\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcd7 BEST STUDY GUIDES FOR YOU\n\u25aa TMC Test Bank \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu\n\u25aa Hacking the TMC Exam \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2XBc8do\n\u25aa TMC Exam Bundle (Save $) \ud83d\udc49 https://bit.ly/34pqEsV\n\u25aa Daily TMC Practice Questions \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C\n\n\ud83d\udc99MORE FROM RTZ\n\u25aa Free TMC Practice Exam \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2XlwASL\n\u25aa Free RRT Cheat Sheet \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB\n\u25aa Resources for RT's \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo\n\u25aa Testimonials \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl\n\n\ud83c\udf10FOLLOW US\n\u25aa Instagram \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV\n\u25aa Twitter \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1\n\u25aa Facebook \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2MSEejt\n\u25aa Pinterest \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw\n\n\ud83d\ude91MEDICAL DISCLAIMER\nMedicine and Respiratory Therapy are continuously changing practices.

    "description": "In this video I quickly cover the EK Loop Connect with an unboxing, installing and a short review.\nAll in all the Loop Connect is packed full of features and still has more to be unlocked with future products for EKWB. At its price point it is very competitive with Corsairs iCUE Commander PRO, which you actually need additional parts, not just the Commander alone. On the flip side the iCUE software is far easier to use and program where as the Connect program almost feels broken.\n\nI highly recommend the EK Loop Connect as it is cheaper and does not lock you down into its environment like Corsair does.\n\n\u25baTools I Use:\niFixit Manta Driver Kit | https://amzn.to/2Lt0e49 (PAID LINK)\nARCTIC MX-4 Thermal Paste | https://amzn.to/38sXRay (PAID LINK)\n70% Rubbing Alcohol | https://amzn.to/3nsTwIw (PAID LINK)\nMini Vacuum Attachments | https://amzn.to/38pglsA (PAID LINK)\nCordless Wet-Dry Vacuum | https://amzn.to/35nruIs (PAID LINK)\n\n\u25baVideo Equipment I Use:\nSony ZV-1 Camera | https://amzn.to/3q2DyGZ (PAID LINK)\nMic | https://amzn.to/3bnxFQy (PAID LINK)\nLighting | https://amzn.to/39i1Gi7 (PAID LINK)\nLogitech BRIO | https://amzn.to/3shu6BA (PAID LINK)\n\n\u25baComputer Peripherals I Use:\nKeyboard | https://amzn.to/2Xl2Cg9 (PAID LINK)\nMouse | https://amzn.to/3i3vzGY (PAID LINK)\nHeadphones | https://amzn.to/2XqKTnv (PAID LINK)\nMonitor | https://amzn.to/3hWGZfq (PAID LINK)\nUSB / Card Reader | https://amzn.to/3bmCWYD (PAID LINK)\nLight | https://amzn.to/35onGXs (PAID LINK)\nLogitech BRIO | https://amzn.to/3shu6BA (PAID LINK)\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:17 Unboxing\n0:48 Install\n1:58 Review\n2:38 Outro\n\n\u25ba Check out my social media channels for more content: \nWebsite: https://www.MikeLikesThat.com/\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3wBeLbQxbfNAxCqjyf-sEw\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MikeLikesThat\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mikelikesthat/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mikelikesthat/",

A journey becomes a pilgrimage as we discover day by day that the distance traveled is less important than the experience gained.\nNow is the best time to take out your old travel photos and take a look at the beautiful moments you have spent among loved ones and places that you adore.\nPerhaps make yourself a nice tea and grab some snacks for a little memory adventure.\nA healthy mind hosts a healthy imagination, and best of all there are no limitations to where you can go! Research suggests that imagining doing something can have a similar impact on our bodies and minds as actually doing the activity. So why not take yourself on a quiet picnic in Auroville or better yet a jungle safari or a refreshing walk on the beach, just make sure to remember the snacks.\n\nAt Auroville.com we are grateful for your continued support and we love making new friends, for more information follow the links in the description below the video and thank you for subscribing on your way out. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFind us on \n\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY4Wz_QQOVMUiRK_QJogO5g \nFacebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/aurovilledotcom/\nInstagram \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/aurovilledotcom/\n\nThat brings us to the end of this video, but if you want more totally free \"Ideas For Traveling During Lockdown\" suggestions, visit our website at http://bit.ly/IdeasForTravelingDuringLockdown\n\nThank you for enjoying.

No matter if you intend to use it as a playroom, a family room, a bedroom, an office, or just a finished laundry and storage area, that additional area could make a significant impact in the ease and convenience of your everyday life. In addition to extra space, a basement which is properly finished reduces the very common issue of damp and moldy basement areas. Water problems in the basement could cause all sorts of damage to the floors, the walls, and everything else you have stored in the basement. Perhaps the worse impact, though, is the growth and spread of actual mold. Any time you fix moisture problems and finish a basement area, most of these troubling issues go away.\n\nAn often forgotten benefit is the extra cash value that a finished basement provides to your home. Although procedures vary from place to place, a properly finished basement can generally be included in the official square footage measurements of your home. This certainly adds to the value of your home. Even in the event that your basement does not fully get eligible to be counted as part of the square footage, potential buyers will look at that area and understand its value to the ease and convenience of their life style. This could make a huge difference when it comes to convincing prospective buyers to follow through with an offer. From everyday living to financial benefit, finished basements provide lots of benefits to you as a homeowner.\n\n\nPlease Comment and Subscribe!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/LuxRenovations\n\nAre you looking to finish your basement in Winthrop?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBkX0sMqdfo",

We try to give you some insight into the rural real estate business and offer ideas and information to help you better manage and enjoy your own property.\n\nPhone / Zoom Consultations:\n\nPlease don\u2019t let what you\u2019re about to read bum you out\u2026due to the large and growing number of phone visits I\u2019ve had in the last several months, and the amount of time they have been taking up, I\u2019ve started charging a modest fee for the phone / Zoom consultations just to weed out those who aren\u2019t serious about what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. It\u2019s officially $75 for 30 - 45 minutes, but most calls have been going a little longer just because it\u2019s hard to stop when talking with someone who\u2019s anxious to do things at a higher level. I have also been sending 1-3 (now 4!) of our print books as a gift if the person doesn\u2019t already have them. Any follow-up calls / Zooms over the next 2 months after the initial call are at $50. Again\u2026sorry\u2026and hope you don\u2019t see this as me thinking I\u2019m \u201call that.\u201d It\u2019s just gotten pretty overwhelming. Thanks for understanding.\n\nLet me know if you want to schedule a call / Zoom and I\u2019ll shoot you a PayPal link to pay and a short form to complete so I can do some prep work and be better prepared for our call. Once that is done, you can choose a date/time that works best for you.\n\nChapters:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:23 - Right of Ways can have Pros & Cons\n0:44 - Pro - Provides Access & Hunting Use\n1:20 - Hard to Move Harvested Timber\n1:56 - This Gas Line is in Remote Part of Tract\n2:21 - Not a \"One Size Fits All\" Situation\n\nSee our company website at http://www.RecLand.net.\n\nRecLand sells rural real estate at http://www.recland.net.\n\n#ruralrealestate\n\nSee all Pat's land-related real estate books HERE .. http://amzn.to/2ih5Oro\n\nPodcasts: 2 Shows\n\niTunes & Android: Just search for RecLand Talks and RecLand Realty - anywhere you listen to podcasts.\n\nMain Company Site - http://www.RecLand.net\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/reclandrealty\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/reclandtalks\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/recland\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/reclandtalks\n\nEmail: office@recland.net\n\nSnail Mail:\n\nRecLand\n410 Olive Street\nMonroe, LA 71201",

    "description": "In this video I'll show you how to update your JBL portable Bluetooth speaker firmware. This process works for all JBL Flip, JBL Charge and JBL Xtreme model speakers.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntroduction: 0:00\nSteps to Update JBL Portable Bluetooth Speaker Firmware: 0:47\nConclusion: 2:25\n\nSupport this channel by becoming a member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbDWMccTJCL0WmbMHNLZIw/join\n\nVideo Transcript:\nJBL portable Bluetooth speakers offer a great blend of toughness, quality audio, and portability. To ensure that you keep getting the most out of your speaker you need to make sure your device is running the latest firmware version. Firmware updates are how JBL addresses issues that were discovered after devices are shipped, and also how new features and functionality can be added. Thankfully JBL makes it easy to update your JBL speaker firmware through a mobile app for iPhone, iPad and Android devices.\n\nNow let's walk through the steps to update your JBL portable Bluetooth speaker firmware. Again, this process will work for all JBL Flip, JBL Charge and JBL Xtreme models.\n\nStep 1. Download the JBL Portable app from either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store if you don't have the app already. Again, the only way to update the firmware on your JBL portable Bluetooth speaker is through the app.\n\nStep 2. Turn on your JBL Bluetooth speaker and then launch the app. Your speaker should be displayed on the main screen, but if it isn't you'll also want to make sure your Bluetooth speaker is paired with your iPhone, iPad or Android device.\n\nStep 3. If an update is available for your JBL portable Bluetooth speaker you'll see an Update button below the image of your speaker. If you don't see an Update button, then there is no firmware update available for your speaker. Tap \"Update\" if you see it. The Firmware Update screen will be displayed, letting you know what software version you'll be updating to, and what issues will be addressed.\n\nStep 4. Tap \"Upgrade.\" A circle is shown on the screen, displaying the percent complete associated with the update, and also an estimate of how much time is remaining. It's important to note that your speaker may turn itself on and off during this process, and that you shouldn't manually turn it on or off while the update is underway. When the firmware update is complete an Upgrade Successful screen is shown.\n\nStep 5. Tap \"Let's Party.\" The firmware update is complete and you can continue using your JBL portable Bluetooth speaker.",

Pets can\u2026\n\u2022 Lower stress\n\u2022 Rid anxiety\n\u2022 Rid depression symptoms \n\nThe reason pets have this effect on people is for five primary reasons. Having a pet can\u2026\n1. Lower your cortisol levels - cortisol is known as the \u201cstress hormone\u201d\n2. Lower your blood pressure levels\n3. Increase your levels of oxytocin - this can improve your sense of wellbeing and support pregnant mothers \n4. Increase endorphins - this helps minimize discomfort and maximize pleasure\n5.

Sign up for a G Suite account \ud83d\udc49 https://punchsalad.com/lp/g-workspace/ \n\nNo idea why they make all of this so confusing, but I hope after this video you have a clear understanding. \n\nGmail vs Google Workspace (G Suite): \nHow to set up a custom domain in Workspace: https://youtu.be/grqmNBfC2vQ\n\n00:00 The video in summary\n\n00:26 What is Google Account\n\nLet\u2019s start with Google Account, which is essentially the account that controls all other Google products. It sits on top, controlling the rest, and with this account,\nyou are able to login to all the other Google services, like youtube, docs, drive & Gmail.\nNow you don\u2019t need a Gmail account to have access to Google products.\n\nYou just need an existing email address to signup for a google account then you can use all their services. For example, at the office we use outlook but I still have a Google Account\nWhich I access with the outlook email and I\u2019m able to use services like Docs, Analytics, and Search Console.\n\nIf you want to create a Google account without Gmail, check out the white video card that should appear here on top. I\u2019ll take you through the steps in that video.\n\n01:19 What is Gmail\n\nNext, let me talk about Gmail. Which is the email service from Google.\nIt\u2019s just one of the services that Google offers for free. If you signup to Gmail, you will have an email that has gmail.com at the end. Which works really well for personal use,\nit\u2019s easy to use and comes with plenty of storage space.\n\nSo this means if you have a Gmail account, then you also have a Google Account, but not all Google Accounts have a Gmail account.\n\n01:54 What is Google Workspace (G Suite)\n\nOn the other hand, Google workspace or formerly known as G Suite is like having a Google account, but it\u2019s for business, and the prices start from six dollars at least at the time I recorded this video. The cool thing is that with Workspace your email can look something like this: robert@mybusiness.com so you can see it has my name and my business domain at the end.\n\nWeirdly, Workspace doesn\u2019t have all the Google Account services, but you are able to signup for the missing services for free\n\nHosting I'm using: https://punchsalad.com/hostpapa/ (60% discount) \nWhere I get my domains: https://punchsalad.com/namecheap-domain/\nWP plugins I'm using: https://punchsalad.com/recommendations?utm_campaign=gServicesDif&utm_medium=social&utm_source=youtube \nSome of the above links might be affiliate links.",

    "title": "Glycogen - What Is Glycogen?",
    "description": "In this video I discuss what is glycogen, some of the functions of glycogen, and how many carbs to fill glycogen stores.  I also discuss where glycogen storage takes place and how much glycogen is stored in the body.\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\nWhat is glycogen?  To answer this, we are going to start with carbohydrates.  \n\nWhen we eat carbs, our body breaks them down into what is called glucose.  Glucose is the main source of energy, or fuel for cells.  When the cells are full of fuel, the body takes this extra energy and converts it to glycogen.  \n\nSo, glycogen is a form of energy storage in the body.  It is estimated that the body stores about 2000 calories worth of energy as glycogen.\n\nIt gets stored in mainly 2 places, in muscles, and in the liver.  Glycogen that is stored in the liver can be used by other organs and cells in the body.  Glycogen that is stored in muscles is not shared, so it is used only by muscle cells.  It is estimated that The liver will store about 400 calories of energy, and muscles will store about 1600 calories of energy.\n\nNow we are going take a basic look at how this works.  Lets say that jack here is about to eat.  His liver glycogen tank is \u00be full, and his muscle glycogen tank is 3/4 full.  Jack eats his meal, and the carbs are broken down into glucose.  \n\nSome of this glucose is sent by the liver, into the bloodstream to cells throughout his body.  The liver takes the extra glucose and converts it to glycogen and stores it for later use, filling up his liver glycogen tank.\n\nIn between meals when energy is needed, the liver breaks the glycogen down into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream, as you can see the glycogen tank starts to empty until jack eats again.\n\nOne note here, fat can also be converted to energy to be used, and I will cover that in another video.  \n \nThe process will be similar in the muscles.  Jacks muscle glycogen tank was \u00be full before his meal. After his meal, the tank is full.  In between meals, jack is moving around, causing his muscle glycogen tank to become depleted.\n\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 What is glycogen?\n0:22 Glycogen storage in the body\n0:54 How glycogen is stored in the body",

    "description": "If you\u2019re trying to lower your cortisol, don\u2019t forget about zinc!\u00a0\n\nDATA:\nhttps://medcraveonline.com/MOJT/the-effect-of-zinc-supplementation-on-salivary-cortisol-levels-and-salivary-amylase-activity-in-primary-school-children-with-low-socioeconomic-status.html \n\nTimestamps\n0:00 Zinc and cortisol\u00a0\n0:07 Zinc could help lower cortisol\u00a0\n0:32 Zinc and GABA\u00a0\n0:42 Zinc and copper\u00a0\n1:05 Hidden infections and zinc\u00a0\n1:50 Foods rich in zinc\u00a0\n\nToday we\u2019re going to talk about the influence of zinc over cortisol. Zinc is a trace mineral that has a huge influence over the HPA axis. The HPA axis is basically a feedback loop going through the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands. Zinc supports this whole pathway. When you take zinc, it could actually help lower cortisol. Zinc also increases GABA, which is very calming.\u00a0\n\nWhen you\u2019re low in zinc, you\u2019re going to be a little bit higher in copper because they work together. But, lower zinc and higher copper is not good.\n\nThis situation could create copper toxicity, which could cause:\u00a0\n \u2022 Anxiety\u00a0\n \u2022 Depression\u00a0\n \u2022 Higher cortisol\u00a0\n \u2022 Your body to go into stress mode\u00a0\n\nIf you have a hidden infection combined with stress and inflammation, this situation could deplete your zinc and raise your cortisol.\u00a0\n\nA few good sources of zinc:\n \u2022 Shellfish\u00a0\n \u2022 Pumpkin seeds\u00a0\n \u2022 Brazil nuts\u00a0\n\nIf you have a stress issue or you can\u2019t sleep, and you\u2019re trying to do everything you can to fix the issue, you may also want to include zinc.\u00a0\n\nFREE COURSE\u279c \u279c http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nTalk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!\nCall 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.

Low water temperature and cycle options can both add time to your cycle. Dishwashers require a minimum incoming water temperature of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit to keep cycle times at a minimum. Otherwise it takes the dishwasher a longer time to heat the water. \n(0:45) Step 1: To reduce cycle time make sure that the water is hot prior to running the dishwasher.\n(0:51) Step 2: Run the faucet closest to the dishwasher to clear the cold water in the pipeline. \n(0:56) Step 3: To check whether you have the right water temperature, turn on the hot water faucet nearest to the dishwasher for a couple minutes to clear any cold water from the pipes. \n(1:07) Step 4: Fill a cup with hot water. \n(1:09) Step 5: Put a thermometer in the cup and read the temperature. \n(1:13) Step 6: If the water temperature is under 120 degrees Fahrenheit, have a qualified person raise the hot water heater thermostat setting. \nCycle options like heat dry, high-tempo wash and sani-rinse can add between 20 to 40 minutes to your regular cycle time.

Also having two specialist midwives...that to me was a no-brainer.\n\nI did discuss the home birth with both midwives then with friends and family I got mixed feedback I think people were most concerned with the 'what if' scenario but I reassured them that if anything were to happen you're transferred immediately.\n\nOne of my midwives was massaging my lower back throughout. Husband was nowhere in sight but the midwife was massaging and was brilliant...I just wanted to be at home and to be able to have my cup of tea and toast in my own bed.\n\nThe midwife came around 2.30am but I wasn't in established labour yet so she went away and said 'just call us back if something changes' I said 'what does that mean if something changes?'I didn't really know what she meant by that 'So if my waters break?' she said 'Yeh' 'then definitely phone us'...I was using a TENS machine so I So I put the TENS machine on about 6.15am and at 6.30am my waters broke I phoned the midwife...she came I got in the pool at about 7am so at 7.45am she was born.\n\nOnce the decision has been made to have a home birth you know that you can't have any harder medicines so it doesn't even come into play when you're in labour I think you have a change in mindset as well.\n\nJust make sure that you can be as comfortable as possible and explore all your options talk to your midwife and your partner about your options and just make sure that whatever decision you come to is the right one for you.\n\nIf you have a slight inclination if a home birth is for me? Then definitely look into it and speak to midwives and other parents and just do as much research as possible.",

    "description": "Finding Great Restaurants in Madrid, Spain\nMadrid is the capital and largest city in Spain. There are great museums, but what I really wanted was the great Spanish food... churros, a Spanish tortilla, and of course jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico.\n\nMy first stop Was San Gines, which is known for its warm churros with chocolate. Lines can get long, so it's best to come during off-hours.\n\nI then made my way to the neighborhood of Malasa\u00f1a, where Tipos Infamous is a book store where you can order Spanish wine while you browse the books.\n\nSan Miguel Market has stands that showcase a wide variety of Spanish food, so if you want an introduction to many things, come here.\n\nFor dinner, I went to Sobrino de Botin, which is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest restaurant in the world. It opened in 1725 and is known for its specialty, suckling pig.\n\nIf you've never had a Spanish Tortilla, then the most famous place might be Bodega de la Ardosa. It's made with eggs and potatoes. I messed up this part, as there is no cheese in it. Oops! I found that sweet Vermouth is popular to drink in Madrid, so I decided to partake in a glass. This is perhaps my favorite part of town.\n\nFinally, I had some jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico de Belotta, which comes from acorn-fed pigs, and then aged for 6 months.\n\n0:00 Welcome to Madrid\n0:15 Churros\n0:35 San Miguel Market\n0:52 The Oldest Restaurant in the World\n1:06 The Best Tortilla\n\nFollow for more fun videos about food, drink, and travel!\n\nCheck out our more videos you may like.\n\nWhat New York City is Like Right Now\n\u21aa https://youtu.be/HufdgJWldGw\n\nThe Most Beautiful Street in Playa del Carmen\n\u21aa https://youtu.be/3D27aVEAGQQ\n\nMy Favorite Places in Isla Mujeres\n\u21aa https://youtu.be/2FaHhC9m93Y\n\nMy Top 7 Tips for Playa del Carmen\n\u21aa https://youtu.be/Y63ZwBM6RRY\n\nNYC Restaurants are Closing at an Alarming Rate\n\u21aa https://youtu.be/CgSOTiRfH7o\n\nThank you for watching this video about my weekend in Madrid.

I'm studying this group of proteins called fold switching proteins. So, they can actually change their structures and their functions in response to changes in the cell. So, you can kind of imagine fold switching proteins are like a transformer where in one case the protein is like a robot that does one thing and then in another case, in response to changes in our bodies, it becomes a car and can do something else. And an advantage to this is it can respond really quickly to changes in our bodies. Back in high school I did not imagine myself being a scientist at all. Before going to college, I did kind of fall in love with math like when I took calculus. I was like wow this is so cool! It was like the first time I realized that math could be useful for something beyond balancing my checkbook. At the end of my sophomore year of college my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma. He went through multiple rounds of chemo and it was just a really hard process just watching that happen and and like thinking I wonder if there's a better way. Some of the proteins that I'm working on that actually do this phenomenon called fold switching are actually associated with diseases so cancer, Alzheimer's, autoimmune disease bacterial and viral infections. If by the end of my life even one successful treatment was made based on this that would be amazing. NLM has a really strong track record in computation. There are a lot of excellent scientists here and so I thought it would be great to be able to work with them. I'm also like really grateful to have the freedom to pursue what I want to do and I'm really like happy to be here and be able to like take chances that I probably couldn't do in most other environments.\u201d",

Here are 4 Steps for Converting an Unfinished Basement Into Your Favorite Place!\n\n0:06 Finishing Your Basement Is A Major Project But...\n0:23 Need An Extra Bedroom\n0:53 Determine Your Budget And Consider Time\n1:15 Learn A Simple Way To Get It Done\n\nBasement Finishing can be a major project but does not have to be a stressful one. There are four essential steps to take to help get going:\n\nStep 1: You must plan how you may use your brand-new living area. Whether you would want a family- entertainment area, play area for the youngsters, or perhaps you need an additional bedroom. It is important to decide how your family will utilize the space.\n\nNext step is to figure out your budget and take into account the time it can take to complete. It may be helpful to talk to an expert design consultant.\nAfter this you will want to know how much time the project takes. For example, typical drywall installations might take up to two months and require multiple contractors in and out of your home.\n\nStep 3: You should determine what materials will be used for finishing your basement.

Greek is spoken by some 13 million people, primarily in the Mediterranean nation of Greece, and by significant communities in Eastern Europe and North America. Pontic, a closely related language, is spoken by about 1.2 million people, primarily in Greece's north. Translations below:\n\nGreek (00:00:00):\nMy parents were refugees to Greece.

He knew all those languages. And my mother was from Tbilisi, from Georgia, from Tbilisi, Georgia. And that village of my mother was called Sekitli, 15km outside Tbilisi. My mother went to Greece in 1914, as refugees, she was 7 years old. And my father came to Greece in 1922.\n\nPontic (00:00:57):\nMy father was born in Russia. His homeland was Kars. My mother was born in Tbilisi in Georgia, and her village was called Sekitli. They came to Lahana, Thessaloniki as a refugee in 1914 my mother. And in 1922 came my father. My mother's name was Eleni, and my father's name was Yiorgo (George). They got married in Lahana and that's where they settled. They left for D\u00edmitra (village). There they had their children, their home, and farm\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7MUi/",

    "description": "0:00 - Male koel: Asian Koel is a large cuckoo. The adult male has glossy bluish-black or greenish-black plumage. Wings are relatively short, but the tail is rather long. The thick, large bill is slightly down-curved and very pale in colour. Eyes are bright red. Legs and feet are pale grey.\n\n0:20 - Female koel: Female has smooth brown upperparts, heavily speckled with creamy white. Underparts are cream to whitish, finely barred with dark brown bars. The tail is barred dark grey and white. Crown is a darker brown. Bill is pale greenish. Eyes are red. \nJuvenile resembles female but it has dark eyes. \nWe can find up to 14 subspecies.\n\n1:24 - Green Bee-eater: A small dainty bee-eater that is intensely green overall with a greenish-blue throat, a thin black throat band, and long central tail feathers. In-flight, note the dark edge along the lower border of the wings. Juveniles are duller than adults and lack the long tail feathers. In some parts of its range, birds may have a rusty crown or a bright blue throat. Flies gracefully as it catches insects and other prey. Common in open woodlands, fields, farmlands, and around sparse human habitation. Some populations show seasonal movements. Calls are a series of gentle liquid trills.\n\nSource: oiseaux-birds & ebird\n\nThis footage is part of the broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It can lead to soil erosion, mosquito breeding grounds, or even seep into your home\u2019s foundation. Forget the quick fix\u2014here\u2019s how to take care of it before it spirals into a bigger, more costly issue.  \n\n******************************\nResources:\nNDS Stormwater Drainage Tools App\n\nNDS Stormwater Management Channel\n\u25b6\ufe0e https://www.youtube.com/c/Ndspro\n\nHome Drainage Center\nhttps://www.ndspro.com/home-drainage\n\nCatch Basins\nhttps://www.ndspro.com/products/drainage/catch-basins.html\n\nDrain Grates\nhttps://www.ndspro.com/products/drainage/grates.html\n\nPop-up Drainage Emitters\nhttps://www.ndspro.com/products/drainage/pop-up-emitters.html\n\n******************************\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:12 - Problem\n0:47 - Solution\n\n*** *** ***\n\nRAINFALL CREATES RUNOFF\nWhen rain falls on your roof, rain gutters collect the water and channel it through downspouts. Most drainage systems end there\u2014causing water to puddle at the base of your home. \n\nSO WHAT\u2019S THE PROBLEM?\nWithout the right drainage system, rainwater can make its way into your home\u2019s foundation, causing settling or cracking, flooding in your basement, and the growth of dangerous mold, mildew, and wood rot. With wet wood, you\u2019ve got the perfect environment for termite and other insect infestations. \n\nQUICK FIXES DON\u2019T WORK\nA properly installed drainage system can help you avoid such property damage and health risks, by moving water away from your home. But many homeowners try quick fixes, such as moving dirt and digging trenches, and end up dissatisfied because these approaches are most often ineffective and temporary. \n\nINSTALL A LASTING DRAINAGE SOLUTION\nWith NDS, you can create a lasting drainage solution easily and inexpensively. Start planning your drainage project today! Drainage solutions such as area drains and catch basins can help capture excess runoff.  With gravity, the water is conveyed downstream through connected drain pipes, and directed to a pop-up emitter for release in a water-safe area.

A lost ring remains in the sand until mother nature or another metal detectorist with the right equipment comes along and ruins all chances of returning to its rightful owner. The woman finally came up with the idea to search the web for \u201cring finding service,\u201d and my info came right up. After a quick discussion explaining of details surrounding her lost ring, we agreed on a date to conduct the search. I arrived at the location first to find multiple beachgoers still soaking up the late evening rays. I decided to get started with the search ahead of her arrival based on her description of the lost ring\u2019s approximate location. She did a great job explaining where she was sitting that day because after only 30 minutes of searching, 20 bottle caps, and pissing off half of the beachgoers, I found the lost diamond ring she thought was gone forever! Another lost ring was found and reunited with its owner.\n\nAt this point, I had the lost ring, and the unsuspecting owner still hadn\u2019t arrived\u2026 What would be an unforgettable way to return a valuable possession? The fake-out, of course!!! Check out the YouTube video to see her shocking response!\n\nLost a piece of jewelry on the beach? Lost a ring in the water? Jewelry is commonly lost during our favorite summertime activities. Don\u2019t waste your time with a metal detector rental or with a local hobbyist, contact a professional member of The Ring Finders metal detecting service. I serve states throughout New England in including Block Island and Fishers Island.\n\n#misquamicutstatebeach #lostring #rediscoverlost\n\nClick SUBSCRIBE and then click the bell symbol to turn on notifications.

The lower range seems effective... although, the optimal dose is yet to be discovered.\n\n00:00 Intro\n0:03 Side Effects\n0:30 Withdrawals\n0:45 Benefits of Phenylpiracetam\n0:55 What It Feels Like\n1:38 Getting Out Of A Slump\n1:55 Rhodiola, Bacopa and Ashwandha Use\n\nhttp://www.patreon.com/thenootropicreviewer\n\n#Phenylpiracetam #Nootropic #Nootropics\n\n\ud83d\udc8c\nSign up for my newsletter: http://thenootropicrev.com\n\nIMPROVE YOUR FOCUS: \ud83d\udc8a \nhttps://geni.us/hpxQ2H8\n\nLOWER YOUR STRESS: \ud83d\ude21\nhttps://geni.us/2zJS0tA\nhttps://geni.us/fodKu (U.K.)\n\n\nLION'S MANE: \ud83d\ude42\nhttps://geni.us/B2k2Xpr\nhttps://geni.us/LionsManeUK (U.K.)\n\nL-TYROSINE: \ud83d\udc8a \nhttps://geni.us/HiUr\n\nRHODIOLA ROSEA: \ud83d\udc8a \nhttps://geni.us/MMqF\n\nASHWAGANDHA: \ud83d\udc8a \nhttps://geni.us/19g0YE\nhttps://geni.us/QJyt (U.K.)\n\nBACOPA MONNIEIRI: \ud83d\udc8a \nhttps://geni.us/AWLD9AL\nhttps://geni.us/aPaBu (U.K.)\n\nALPHA GPC: \ud83d\udcb0\nhttps://geni.us/QJyt\nhttps://geni.us/MGNMZcd\n\n\nSAY HI ON SOCIAL:\n\nWebsite: https://www.thenootropicrev.com\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2snndo6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2Qrb75c\nInstagram: http://www.instagram/thenootropicreviewer\nAffiliate Links:\n\n**NOOTROPICSDEPOT Coupon Code \u27a1\ufe0f 'NOOTROPICREVIEWER10'.

    "description": "Outdoor Fireplaces Atlanta | The Fireplace Place\n\nHi, I'm Devlin Pierce with The Fireplace Place. I'd like to talk briefly with you about outdoor fireplaces. If you're looking to put an outdoor fireplace in your home, man! do we have options you're going to love.\n\nAlong with outdoor kitchens, outdoor fireplaces have grown in popularity since the crash of 2008.  The largest reason for this is the fact that many people are underwater on their mortgage and cannot sell their homes.  They are spending money to update them and to make them more marketable.  Combine that with the weather in Georgia, then you have the perfect storm for creating an outdoor living space.\n\nWith today\u2019s beautiful and convenient gas fireplaces and tables, this is a home run for many families.  After working all day, who wants to come home and build a fire?  With the click of a button, our gas fireplaces and tables are an immediate stress reliever.  Accompany this outdoor fireplace with an outdoor kitchen and you will never want to go out again.\n\nIf you enjoy burning wood, we recommend a fireplace with a full chimney.  Fire pits are cool in theory, but who wants to be chased around by smoke and smell like you've been camping at the end of the night?  We have prefabricated options that are a fraction of the price of traditional masonry fireplaces.  Best yet is, they are 304 stainless steel and will not rust.  They get the smoke up and out of your face and also make a great place for your outdoor television.\n\nTo build a quality outdoor fireplace it all starts with the foundation and framework.  If exposed to the elements, we recommend that it is completely built out of non-combustible materials.  A common shortcut is to frame the fireplace enclosure with pressure-treated wood.  This Is problematic due to the fact that wood absorbs moisture which will cause the wood to swell.  This will, in turn, damage your fascia and ruin your investment. A popular way to finish your fireplace is to match or accent the aesthetics of your home, whether it is stucco, brick, stacked rock, or tile.\n\nIf building an elaborate outdoor fireplace doesn't excite you, then purchasing a simple gas fire table should do the trick.  Gas tables come in many shapes and sizes. You can choose a contemporary linear coffee table or a traditional looking one with logs.  The great thing about this option is that you can take it wherever you go.\n\nWhether your budget is $500 or $10,000, we can guide you through our complimentary design audit to find the products that match your family\u2019s needs and wants.\n\nYour choice of vendor could be potentially dangerous to you and your family and is all the more reason to make sure that you are using a competent, knowledgeable company.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to add an outdoor fireplace to your home, check us out online at www.efireplaceplace.com or call us: 770-999-0643 for all of your Atlanta fireplace, hearth, or outdoor cooking needs.

    "title": "Must Bishops Be Married?",
    "description": "Must Bishops Be Married? \n\nSome Protestants quote 1 Timothy 3:2 as proof that the Catholic discipline of celibate bishops is contrary to the bible. But does this text show what Protestants think it does? In this video, Karlo explains why it doesn\u2019t and what Paul really meant.\n\nFor more information about this topic, please visit our website at: catholic.com.\n\nCopyright Catholic Answers, Inc. 2016\n\nSTAY CONNECTED!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/catholicanswers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/catholiccom\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/catholicans\n\nHELP US make more videos like this one!\nhttps://donate.catholic.com/support-c...\n\nBOOK KARLO for your event!\nhttp://www.catholicanswersspeakers.co...\n\nAbout Karlo Broussard:\n\nKarlo Broussard, a native of Crowley, Louisiana, left a promising musical career to devote himself full-time to the work of Catholic apologetics. For more than a decade he has traveled the country teaching apologetics, biblical studies, theology, and philosophy. Karlo has published articles on a variety of subjects in Catholic Answers Magazine, is a regular guest on Catholic Answers Live, and is an active blogger at catholic.com.\n\nKarlo holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in theology from Catholic Distance University and the Augustine Institute, and is currently working on his masters in philosophy with Holy Apostles College and Seminary. He also worked for several years in an apprenticeship with nationally known author and theologian Fr. Robert J. Spitzer at the Magis Center of Reason and Faith.\n\nKarlo is one of the most dynamic and gifted Catholic speakers on the circuit today, communicating with precision of thought, a genuine love for God, and an enthusiasm that inspires.\n\nScript:\nDoes the Catholic Church contradict the bible with its discipline for celibate bishops? Some Protestants think so, since Paul says in 1 Timothy 3:2 that \u201ca bishop must be\u2026the husband of one wife.\u201d\n\nIs Paul forbidding a celibate clergy? No, and here are some reasons why.\n\nFirst, if this interpretation were correct, then we\u2019d have to say that Paul couldn\u2019t be a bishop since he was celibate. But that\u2019s absurd. Paul was a bishop inasmuch as he was an apostle. The apostolic office is even described with the Greek word episkope in Acts 1:20, which is the word for the office of a bishop.\n\nMoreover, we\u2019d have to deny Jesus\u2019 role as the \u201cguardian\u201d of our soul in 1 Peter 2:25, which no Christian wants to do. The Greek word for \u201cguardian\u201d is episkopos. Jesus is the bishop of our souls, but yet he was and still is celibate.\n\nWhat Paul is emphasizing in 1 Timothy 3 is the number of marriages, not marriage itself. If he meant marriage itself, then he would have said something like, \u201cthe husband of a wife\u201d and not \u201cthe husband of one wife.\u201d The term \u201cone\u201d indicates that he is placing a limit on the number of times a bishop could have been married in his lifetime. In other words, if a man were married more than once, then he wouldn\u2019t be eligible to be a bishop.\n\nFinally, our Protestant friend\u2019s interpretation doesn\u2019t cohere with Paul\u2019s strong encouragement for celibacy in 1 Corinthians 7. His wisdom about the unmarried man being free from worldly affairs and available to attend to the affairs of the Lord would be unintelligible if he was saying in 1 Timothy 3 that a bishop must be married.\n\nSo, there\u2019s no need for the Catholic Church to let go of its discipline of celibate bishops in order to be in harmony with the bible.\n\nIf you want to learn more about this topic and others like it, visit our website at catholic.com.
